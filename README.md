### As part of automated test, we shall consider and use below items
  - [ ] Introduce Configuration file to parameterize the automation run.
  - [ ] Introduce range of valid values for parameters so automation randomize it and asserts (as an example age or size of input fields etc.)
  - [ ] Introduce range of invalid values to verify application is working as intended or as designed.
  - [ ] Document issues found in your application and do not fix them.   Keep known issues log.
  - [ ] Do not add explicit sleep statement instead rely on valid conditions to make the automation work.
  - [ ] Explore Headless Mode.
  - [ ] Explore Server Module for parallel.
